# Transposition Groups
## a GAP package

This package provides some basic functionality
for transposition groups in GAP.
It is open-source and available for forking on Github.
Extensions and improvements are welcome.

A _transposition group_
is a pair (G,D),
where G is a group and D is a subset of G
consisting of involutions
such that D is normal in G
and D generates G.
This extends Fischer's famous notion of 3-transposition groups.

Installation of the package is as easy as saving a copy of the package
in your package directory;
in my case, this is `~/.gap/pkg/`.
To start the package in GAP,
simply type `LoadPackage("trgps");`.
To create a transposition group object in GAP,
use the command `TranspositionGroup(G,D)`,
where you have previously assigned G and D.
